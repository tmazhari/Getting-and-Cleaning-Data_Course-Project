## Files
The files constituting this repository are as follows:
* run_analysis.R: This file can be run in R studio. This file downloads the required dataset into the data folder of working directory, extracts it and runs different transformation on the dataset to turn it into one clean and tidy dataset. Finally it creates another tidy and clean dataset from the first dataset. 
* CodeBook.md: This file describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that has been performed to clean up the data
* second_tidydata.txt: This is the second tidy and clean dataset which has been made from the first tidy and clean dataset.
